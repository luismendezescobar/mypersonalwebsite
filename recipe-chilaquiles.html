  <ol>
    <li>
      Cook 1 pound tomatillos, 2 or 3 serrano peppers and 1 garlic clove in a

  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet and start frying the tortillas 
      until golden and crisp in batches. You might need to do 2 or 3 batches to 
      avoid overcrowding the skillet. Drain the tortillas on paper towels. 
      Repeat the process with the rest of the tortillas.🥣
    </li>
    <li>
      Clean the skillet with a paper towel, turn the heat to medium and add 1 
      tablespoon of oil.🥄
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sauce and the 3 epazote leaves, let it cook for 5 minutes. 
      Season the sauce with salt.🌿
    </li>    
    <li>
      Carefully stir in the tortillas to avoid breaking them. Add the chicken 
      (if using) and coat it with the salsa. Cook for 2 more minutes.🌮
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve garnished with crumble cheese, cilantro, onion and topped with 
      the cream. Serve with “Refried beans”. Avocado is also a good addition 
      to the plate!🍽
    </li>
